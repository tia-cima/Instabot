# bot_for_instagram
(ENG) A simple way to automate daily Instagram tasks, from commenting on every single post under a certain hashtag to liking all the posts by a single user. Simple and automatic.

The script allows you to perform three types of actions: - By user - By hashtag - Post

In the first case, the available actions are specific to a single user. Is allowed to like and comment under each of his posts, to follow all his followers and also to send him a chosen number of direct.

After there are the hashtags, where the actions are the same: like, comments, follow and direct. The only difference is that the targets will be, for likes and comments, all the posts under a particular hashtag, while for follow and direct, all users with at least one post under that hashtag.

The last operation available is the one related to posts. In fact it is possible to post a single post (photo only) repeated in a chosen time frame, or several different posts always in a chosen time frame.

This is the second "big" project I do, there are some actual improvements but it's not perfect yet, so if there are any problems or things I should solve tell me without destroying me like the guy in the unlimited-emails repository. Thanks.
