## üìñ Description

This Python bot uses the official Instagram APIs to perform various actions on Instagram, including liking and commenting on posts, following users, sending direct messages, and even auto-posting. Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## üéØ What the Code Does

This code contains a Python script that uses the InstaBot library to perform a variety of automated actions on Instagram. Here's a brief overview of the features:

- **User actions**: The bot can like and comment on all posts of a specific user, follow their followers, or send them direct messages (DMs).
- **Hashtag actions**: The bot can like and comment on all posts under a specific hashtag, follow users posting under that hashtag, or send them DMs.
- **Post actions**: The bot can post a single photo or multiple photos at specified time intervals. The photos can be chosen from a specific directory and the captions can be pre-set.

> Please note that using this bot in an incorrect way may lead to your account being banned by Instagram. We don't assume any responsibility for this.

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If not, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install the InstaBot library by running `pip install instabot` in your terminal.
3. Save the provided code in a .py file.
4. Run the file using a Python interpreter, for example by typing `python INSTABOT_MASTER.py` in your terminal.
5. The script will first ask you to input your Instagram account's name and password. Afterwards, you'll be presented with a menu of actions the bot can perform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

When you run the script, it will ask for your Instagram account's username and password. The bot can perform three types of actions:

- **User actions**: Like or comment on a user's posts, follow their followers, or send them DMs.
- **Hashtag actions**: Like, comment, follow, or DM all posts/users under a specific hashtag.
- **Post actions**: Post a single or multiple photos every specified amount of time.

The script will continue running and performing actions until you choose to exit.
